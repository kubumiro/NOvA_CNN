# NOvA_CNN
NOvA neutrino classifiers

Contains the support codes for analysis in DP_kubu.pdf.

The repo includes CVN model with inception modules (model.py), ResNet model (model_resnet.py) and hybrid models combining CNNs with ensemble models.

Both training and inference is implemented in train.py and runable from main.py script. Training for hybrid models is implemented in main_xgb.py.
